## What's this?

In this applet, we'll let you have a simple, fun way to assess yourself and your future partner in a relationship. Just provide a few easy to grasp preferences, and we'll let you know how we think it will go.

Literally, hundreds of time units were spent using vastly complicated neural networks and dual optical sensors on a bipedal intelligent life form researching the subject matter. We are proud we were able to come up with this pure awesome algorithm that can make these predictions with such certainty! We'd tell you the _confidence interval_ and other nitty gitty detail, but on second thought we'll leave that for the paid version.

My evil overlords at <https://class.coursera.org/devdataprod-006/> made me do this. Honest. _There is no warranty, explicit or implied, of fitness for any particular purpose._ I'm just trying to pass this class. Even that isn't guaranteed! But I am putting it in the public domain. If you somehow manage to make *money* of this, I'd be surprised, but more power to you!
